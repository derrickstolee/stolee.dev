Continuing our read through _On Mental Toughness_, I am
excited to share my thoughts on
["The Making of a Corporate Athlete" by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz](https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete).
To excel at one's profession, we must first take care of
our phycial bodies. That gives us energy to pursue the
emotionally and mentally difficult tasks we face. There
is less here that can be specific to software, but this
idea is one that I've experienced for myself over the last
decade. I'll share my personal journey of long-distance
running along with the advice in the article.
