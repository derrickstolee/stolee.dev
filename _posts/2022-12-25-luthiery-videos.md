There comes a time in every software engineer's lifetime where they need
to break out of their digital life and away from screens. I've already
done this in some ways when listening to vinyl records or playing Magic
the Gathering with friends in real life. However, one hobby has become so
common for software engineers that it's practically a meme: woodworking.

Growing up, I learned several handy skills from building things with my
father. This includes helping to build and finish a lake cabin. In grad
school, I built a few pieces of furniture for our small home, but they
were very basic due to building things as quickly as possible without too
much attention to detail.

I've wanted to get back into it and learn real skills and build the focus
to do high-quality finishes. However, I've not found a project that
captivated me enough to want to invest the time, money, and effort into
the process.

Recently, I've been relearning the guitar and enjoy learning about what
makes an electric guitar really work. This led me to discover several
guitar YouTube channels, mostly about learning how to play better. This
did have a side effect: YouTube then recommended some _guitar maker_
channels. That led me down a rabbit hole so deep that I now "know" what it
takes to build a guitar and want to try it myself.

I haven't even started trying to build a guitar, but I have watched many
videos to the point that I have a rough idea of how I want to get started
and level up from there. Here is an inventory of my favorite channels and
particularly helpful videos in case you are interested in getting started.

## Guitar Making Channels

Here is a curated list of my favorite channels for learning about guitar
making. These creators make it look easy, but also film and edit it in a
way that is easy to get lost in their content for hours.

### [tchiks guitars](https://www.youtube.com/@tchiksguitars)

**tchiks guitars** makes beautiful guitars that show the natural features
of wood grain. That is, unless they are making guitars from old Ikea
furniture or other odd restrictions. My favorite videos have no narration,
but demonstrate the creation in careful visual detail. They are relaxing
to watch as well as educational.

To get started, I recommend watching their
[How to make your first guitar at home](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DG0jde7mcR5fuIrA1yUsU3Jt_4W4ouB)
guide. They build a Telecaster style guitar while explaining all of the
details step-by-step as well as the tools being used. It's inspirational,
for sure, even though I don't think I will start my _first_ guitar with
such an ambitious project.

However, I want to highlight a different video,
[their Les Paul build](https://youtu.be/yOO9QWr81eg)
has a lot of details that I aspire to eventually be able to replicate:
carved top on top of the body base, laminated neck, woodworked pick guard,
and many other careful details.

### [Crimson Custom Guitars](https://www.youtube.com/@CrimsonCustomGuitars)

**Crimson Custom Guitars** is probably the biggest guitar making channel
out there. They run their own school and supply shop dedicated to supporting
hobbyists and professionals alike. Their videos include intricate, one-of-a-kind
builds. But also, they include shorter videos about upgrading or repairing
guitars they didn't build.

They also run [the Great Guitar Build Off](https://greatguitarbuildoff.com/),
which is also a great way to find more guitar makers.

To highlight some of the craziest features Crimson Custom Guitars can make,
I recommend [the super cut of the Nebula 2.0 guitar](https://youtu.be/Z4J42JsBReo).
Most guitars can be described as "shaped like &#91;famous guitar brand&#93;"
but this one is in its own category. Take a look at what can be done when
every part of the guitar is rethought and created with precision. Also,
that color finish is unbelievable.

### [Magic Attic Guitars](https://www.youtube.com/@MagicAtticGuitars)

**Magic Attic Guitars** creates works of art. Every guitar has incredible
details, right down to the inlay logo in each headstock. Even with all of
those high-end flourishes, this channel also includes tips and tricks for
everyone to level up in very specific ways.

I've chosen to highlight [Building guitar with wire inlay](https://youtu.be/QKemu6JxGos) because it demonstrates the attention to small details and
decorations.

### [Daisy Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/@DaisyTempest)

**Daisy Tempest** is a more traditional _luthier_ and builds beautiful
acoustic guitars. Her videos are educational and talk about the tools of
the trade in addition to the techniques required. While I'm not planning
to build an acoustic guitar until I'm satisfied with electric guitars.

I want to highlight one of her technique videos, especially
[this one about she does high-end fretwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFqIJkhjgAw).
In particular, I've learned that she always applies binding to the sides
of her fretboard which requires _fret tang nippers_ to cut the part of the
fret that inserts into the fret board so it doesn't cut into the binding.
I've fallen in love with that look and want to build a fretboard that way
myself (just not at first).

### [Noe Hervas](https://www.youtube.com/@NoeHervas)

**Noe Hervas** is probably my most-recent discovery in this vein, but their
work looks really impressive from what I've explored so far. This is
another creator that focuses on high-quality wood and their skills bring
out the natural strengths of the wood.

I want to highlight their ["The Opal" full build](https://youtu.be/EZf9MJbijHo)
as an example of showing all the steps but without words. It's the kind of
video I can watch with a small child in my lap to help them calm down.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZf9MJbijHo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Getting Started Plan

Guitar setup. Learn how to tweak all the things on my own guitars.

Build helper tools such as a neck stand.

Start with a kit. Focus on the finishing and wiring. Complete the project
and learn what areas to focus on again later. Much cheaper in terms of
investment than starting from a body blank. Fret boards and neck seem like
the most complicated things and easiest to get wrong.

Create a custom body blank with prebuilt neck.

## Guitar Making Bucket List

After building from a kit and having a complete project under my belt, I
want to try going into more advanced concepts, such as hand-carving the
neck and fretboard. I'd like to consider laminating the guitar body for
interesting patterns along the edges, or creating a laminated neck for
lines up the neck and headstock. I'd like to create custom fretboard
inlays for the fret markers. Some guitar bodies require binding; the
simple start is to use a plastic binding, but more advanced would be to
bend a wood binding around the guitar. I've also mentioned that I like
the look of binding on a fretboard.

There are a variety of guitar styles that I think I'd like to try, and
from the videos I've seen have some variation in difficulty level. There
are some skills that are absolutely necessary for some (carved top for
Les Pauls) while not as much for others (Telecasters are pretty flat).

Here's my mostly-ordered list of body styles that I'd like to try out:

* Telecaster Style
* Stratocaster or Super-strat style
* Flying V Style
* Explorer Style
* Les Paul Style with curved top
* ES-335 Style with semi-hollow body (bonus for neck-through design)

In some hypothetical future where I've built several electric guitars and
am happy with the results, I'll do another deep dive into acoustic guitar
making and try that on for size. The few acoustic guitar video builds I've
seen show a dramatically different set of techniques that require even
more patience and attention to detail.
